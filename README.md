# Diamond-and-paw-checker-for-graphs
This Python utility allows you to detect paw, diamond, co-paw, and co-diamond subgraphs in small undirected graphs. It works for any graph given as an adjacency matrix and checks all 4-vertex subsets for forbidden induced subgraphs. The complement graph is automatically checked for co-paws and co-diamonds.
